# 4231FinalProject
 
This is my final project for ITCS 4231. The idea for the game was to recreate the logic puzzle game Rush Hour in the Unity engine.

Since this is only a remake, I do not own the original concept behind Rush Hour. However, all models and scripts were created by me. Any other assets were provided by Unity.

Known Issues:

-Due to how pieces move around, they may become unaligned. I have no fix for this besides resetting the level, so please move the pieces carefully!
